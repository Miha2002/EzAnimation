# EzAnimation
### Bachelor's Thesis Project

The purpose of this paper is to develop and present a web application that combines technology and art, offering a simple way to experiment with 2D animation. The motivation behind choosing this topic is the interest in the potential of artificial intelligence to become a useful tool for artists in their creative process, as well as my personal passion for both computer vision and art. The project utilizes a human body position estimation model and various image manipulation methods to generate simple animations. This process is provided in the form of a web application that offers the user multiple ways to input necessary data and allows customization of certain elements. 
The results can be of interest to developers who wish to experiment with these two mediums in the future, as well as for artists who want to utilize digital assistance. 
Using the Python language, the MediaPipe detection model, and specialized libraries, I created a user-friendly application for transforming videos or images into 2D animations, with the option to generate these animations in real-time. For the development of this project, we used the PyCharm IDE from JetBrains, which aided in integrating various libraries and organizing the final files.
